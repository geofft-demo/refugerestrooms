# REFUGE restrooms

Providing safe restroom access for transgender, intersex, and gender noncomforming individuals.

REFUGE is an effort to fill the hole left by the now-defunct Safe2Pee website. It provides a resource for trans\* and queer individuals in need of gender neutral and other safe bathrooms.

This project is open source. Feel free to contribute. We could use the help.

## Set Up For Contributing

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have Ruby 2.0 and PostgreSQL (on Mac, it's recommended to install Postgres with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)).
3. In the repository directory run <code>bundle install</code> to install all dependencies.
4. Make sure Postgres is running, then run <code>rake db:setup</code>. This will create the development database, set it up for the application and fill it with the original safe2pee data, which you can use during development.
5. Optionally, run <code>rake db:fix_accents</code> to clean up encoding problems in the safe2pee data. (Use <code>rake db:fix_accents[dry_run]</code> to preview the changes.)
